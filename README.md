[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

This is a library that helps you backup your Content Model, Content and Assets or move them to a new Contentful space. _It will support Roles & Permissions in a future version._

To import your exported data, please refer to the [contentful-import](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-import) repository.

## :exclamation: Usage as CLI
> We moved the CLI version of this tool into our [Contentful CLI](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli). This allows our users to use and install only one single CLI tool to get the full Contentful experience.
>
> Please have a look at the [Contentful CLI export command documentation](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/export) to learn more about how to use this as command line tool.


## :cloud: Pre-requisites && Installation

### Pre-requisites

- Node LTS

### :cloud: Installation

```bash
npm install contentful-export
```

## :hand: Usage

```javascript
const contentfulExport = require('contentful-export')

const options = {
  spaceId: '<space_id>',
  managementToken: '<content_management_api_key>',
  ...
}

contentfulExport(options)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('Your space data:', result)
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Oh no! Some errors occurred!', err)
  })
```

### Querying

To scope your export, you are able to pass query parameters. All search parameters of our API are supported as documented in our [API documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters).

```javascript
const contentfulExport = require('contentful-export')

const options = {
  spaceId: '<space_id>',
  managementToken: '<content_management_api_key>',
  queryEntries: 'content_type=<content_type_id>'
}

contentfulExport(options)
...
```

The Export tool also support multiple inline queries.

```javascript
const contentfulExport = require('contentful-export')

const options = {
  spaceId: '<space_id>',
  managementToken: '<content_management_api_key>',
  queryEntries: [
    'content_type=<content_type_id>',
    'sys.id=<entry_id>'
  ]
}

contentfulExport(options)
...
```

`queryAssets` uses the same syntax as `queryEntries`

### Export an environment

```javascript
const contentfulExport = require('contentful-export')

const options = {
  spaceId: '<space_id>',
  managementToken: '<content_management_api_key>',
  environmentId: '<environment_id>'
}

contentfulExport(options)
...
```

## :gear: Configuration options

### Basics

#### `spaceId` [string] [required]
ID of the space with source data

#### `environmentId` [string] [default: 'master']
ID of the environment in the source space

#### `managementToken` [string] [required]
Contentful management API token for the space to be exported

#### `deliveryToken` [string]
Contentful Content Delivery API (CDA) token for the space to be exported.

Providing `deliveryToken` will export both entries and assets from the
Contentful Delivery API, instead of the Contentful Management API.
This may be useful if you want to export the latest _published_ versions,
as the management API always only exports the entirety of items, with the latest
unpublished content. So if you want to make sure only to see the latest
published changes, provide the `deliveryToken`.

Just to clarify: When Contentful Management API always returns the latest version (e.g. 50 in this case):

```
  "createdAt": "2020-01-06T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2020-04-07T11:00:00.000Z",
  "publishedVersion": 23,
  "publishedAt": "2020-04-05T14:00:00.000Z",
  "publishedCounter": 1,
  "version": 50,
```

the Content Delivery API would return the `publishedVersion` (23). CDA responses don't include
version number.

Note: Tags are only available on the Contentful Management API, so they will not be exported if you provide a Contenful Delivery Token. Tags is a new feature that not all users have access to.

### Output

#### `exportDir` [string] [default: current process working directory]
Defines the path for storing the export JSON file

#### `saveFile` [boolean] [default: true]
Save the export as a JSON file

#### `contentFile` [string]
The filename for the exported data

### Filtering

#### `includeDrafts` [boolean] [default: false]
Include drafts in the exported entries.

The `deliveryToken` option is ignored
when `includeDrafts` has been set as `true`.
If you want to include drafts, there's no point of getting them through the
Content Delivery API.

#### `includeArchived` [boolean] [default: false]
Include archived entries in the exported entries

#### `skipContentModel` [boolean] [default: false]
Skip exporting content models

#### `skipEditorInterfaces` [boolean] [default: false]
Skip exporting editor interfaces

#### `skipContent` [boolean] [default: false]
Skip exporting assets and entries.

#### `skipRoles` [boolean] [default: false]
Skip exporting roles and permissions

#### `skipWebhooks` [boolean] [default: false]
Skip exporting webhooks

#### `contentOnly` [boolean] [default: false]
Only export entries and assets

#### `queryEntries` [array]
Only export entries that match these queries

#### `queryAssets` [array]
Only export assets that match these queries

#### `downloadAssets` [boolean]
Download actual asset files

### Connection

#### `host` [string] [default: 'api.contentful.com']
The Management API host

#### `proxy` [string]
Proxy configuration in HTTP auth format: `host:port` or `user:password@host:port`

#### `rawProxy` [boolean]
Pass proxy config to Axios instead of creating a custom httpsAgent

#### `maxAllowedLimit` [number] [default: 1000]
The number of items per page per request

#### `limit` [number]
The total number of items to return. Can be used with entries or assets. If not provided, then all entries or assets will be returned. The entries or assets will be ordered using: `sys.createdAt,sys.id`.

#### `headers` [object]
Additional headers to attach to the requests. 

### Other

#### `errorLogFile` [string]
Full path to the error log file

#### `useVerboseRenderer` [boolean] [default: false]
Display progress in new lines instead of displaying a busy spinner and the status in the same line. Useful for CI.

## :rescue_worker_helmet: Troubleshooting

### Proxy

Unable to connect to Contentful through your proxy? Try to set the `rawProxy` option to `true`.

```javascript
contentfulExport({
  proxy: 'https://cat:dog@example.com:1234',
  rawProxy: true,
  ...
})
```

### Error: 400 - Bad Request - Response size too big.

Contentful response sizes are limited (find more info in our [technical limit docs](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/technical-limits/)). In order to resolve this issue, limit the amount of entities received within a single request by setting the [`maxAllowedLimit`](#maxallowedlimit-number-default-1000) option:

```javascript
contentfulExport({
  proxy: 'https://cat:dog@example.com:1234',
  rawProxy: true,
  maxAllowedLimit: 50
  ...
})
```


## :card_file_box: Exported data structure

This is an overview of the exported data:

```json
{
  "contentTypes": [],
  "entries": [],
  "assets": [],
  "locales": [],
  "tags": [],
  "webhooks": [],
  "roles": [],
  "editorInterfaces": []
}
```

*Note:* Tags feature is not available for all users. If you do not have access to this feature, the tags array will always be empty.

## :warning: Limitations

- This tool currently does **not** support the export of space memberships.
- Exported webhooks with credentials will be exported as normal webhooks. Credentials should be added manually afterwards.
- If you have custom UI extensions, you need to reinstall them manually in the new space.
